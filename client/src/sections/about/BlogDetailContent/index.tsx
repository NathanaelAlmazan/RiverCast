            "an average of twenty storms per year, and eight of them reached landfall. These phenomena could cause excessive rainfall resulting " +
            "in flooding. According to the World Bank, floods, cyclones, tsunamis, and landslides had caused 70,000 deaths and twenty-three " +
            "billion dollars in casualties since 1990 in the Philippines. Currently, evacuation protocols rely on detected river levels. " +
            "They issued evacuation orders when the river level reached its critical level. In comparison, the study aims to develop a forecasting " +
            "model that could simulate river behavior weeks in advance using satellite-driven meteorological data. To achieve this mission, the study " +
            "investigated meteorological variables that affects river level significantly and experimented with different models to find the best " +

            "and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), " +
            "and Marikina City Hall. These government agencies facilitated and maintained the meteorological and river level " +

            Time Series Forecasting

            "models to extract these patterns, including Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR), Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving " +
            "Average (ARIMA), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer. While VAR was traditionally used " +
            "for multivariate modeling, recent studies showed its ability to capture non-linear patterns effectively. " +
            "However, deep learning models like LSTM, which outperformed linear auto-regressive models, faced challenges " +

            "Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), addressed these issues and showed promise " +
