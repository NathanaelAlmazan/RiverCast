Imagine you have a big question, like 'What will be the river level tomorrow?' Instead of asking just one person for an answer, you ask a bunch of friends who are really good at predicting weather. Each friend is like a 'tree' in the forest. Now, each friend (or tree) looks at different factors, like if it's cloudy today, how much it rained yesterday, and so on. They each give their own prediction based on these factors. By putting all their answers together, we usually get a more accurate prediction than if we just asked one friend."

It's like looking at a bunch of different things that change over time and trying to predict what will happen next. We tried different multivariate time-series forecasting techniques, like Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR), which is good at spotting patterns in lots of different data, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), which is good at predicting based on past values. Then, there's Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which is a fancy type of neural network that's great at finding patterns in sequences of data. But sometimes, it struggles with really long sequences."}
